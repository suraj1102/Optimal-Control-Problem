# Optimal Control Problem

## TODO:
- [ ] Fix `sample_inputs` function to actually give 20% of the points on the edge
- [ ] Use the `input_range` and `edge_sampling_weight` from hparams in the sample_inpputs function.
- [ ] Save the model
- [ ] Add other control problems into the model
- [ ] Add functionality to set hparams from terminal so we can train multiple problems simultaneously.
- [ ] Add a PINN model
