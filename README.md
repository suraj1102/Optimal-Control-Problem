# Optimal Control Problem

## TODO:
- [x] Fix `sample_inputs` function to actually give 20% of the points on the edge
- [x] Use the `input_range` and `edge_sampling_weight` from hparams in the sample_inputs function.
- [ ] Save the model
- [ ] Add optimizer and scheduler parameters to hparams
- [ ] Add changes required for different architectures
- [x] Early stopping doesn't work
- [ ] Add other control problems into the model
- [ ] Add functionality to set hparams from terminal so we can train multiple problems simultaneously.
- [ ] Add a PINN model
