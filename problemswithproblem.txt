hparams should be with the models
test stability should automatically tell us stable or not
the thing in the problem overrides it
fx gx function names 



----------------------------



segregate Hparams into stuff that WE need to input and stuff that is implied by problem
Abstract the f_x and g_x methods properly and define in child classes
Abstract the control input function into problem
rename Q_R_Matrices to get_ matrices or smth
Abstract test_stability properly so that it does not need to be defined in the child classes (define the variables in constructor)
